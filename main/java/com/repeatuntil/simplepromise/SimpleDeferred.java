 * <p>
 *     The deferred class for a simple promise pattern implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Use this to defer the providing of the result of a task by returning a promise using {@link SimpleDeferred#promise()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     To provide a result call the {@link SimpleDeferred#resolve(Object)} or {@link SimpleDeferred#reject(Object)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     You should not publish instances of this class. Publish the promise instead.
 * </p>
 <p>
 *     <b>Important</b>: Generics are not used by design to keep the implementation's api similar to a loosely typed language's implementation. This makes chaining of deferred tasks easier, but developers need to document the types returned in done and failure callbacks. They also have take care when casting the callback results. We sacrificed static type checking for flexibility.
